# TuneTrend: Decade & Century Song Classification

## Overview
The Song Decade and Century Classifier is a machine-learning project designed to classify songs based on the decade or century in which they were released. The classifier utilizes various features of songs, such as audio characteristics, lyrics, and metadata, to accurately predict the time period to which each song belongs.

## Data Science Steps

Data Science Steps form a structured approach to handling a data science project. I am going to use this project as a guideline to understand and learn how data science projects are to be done.

### Step 1: Learn the Basics
- **Foundational Knowledge**: Familiarize yourself with basic concepts in data science, machine learning, and the specific Python libraries you will use (e.g., pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for machine learning, and librosa for audio feature extraction).

### Step 2: Set Up Your Environment
- **Software and Tools**: Set up Python, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebooks, and install necessary Python packages (requests, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, librosa, matplotlib).

### Step 3: Data Collection
- **Using APIs**: Learn how to fetch data using the Spotify Web API to obtain both track details and audio features. Implement proper handling of API rate limits and authentication mechanisms.
- **Data Storage**: Decide how you will store the collected data (e.g., CSV files, databases).

### Step 4: Data Preprocessing
- **Cleaning Data**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and deal with incorrect or outlier data points.
- **Feature Engineering**: Develop features that are useful for genre classification, including both audio features from Spotify and potentially derived features like genre from artist data.

### Step 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Visualization**: Use matplotlib and seaborn to visualize the distribution of data, relationships between features, and differences between genres.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Apply statistical tests if necessary to understand the significance of features.

### Step 6: Feature Selection
- **Reduction Techniques**: Implement feature selection techniques to reduce dimensionality and focus on the most relevant features for genre classification.

### Step 7: Model Building
- **Algorithm Selection**: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification (e.g., decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks).
- **Model Training**: Train your models using the training dataset.

### Step 8: Model Evaluation
- **Validation Techniques**: Use cross-validation to assess the performance of your model and avoid overfitting.
- **Metrics**: Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

### Step 9: Model Optimization
- **Parameter Tuning**: Utilize grid search or random search to find the optimal parameters for your models.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Consider using ensemble methods to improve the accuracy and robustness of your predictions.

### Step 10: Documentation and Reporting
- **Project Documentation**: Document the entire process, decisions made, and any assumptions in your analysis.
- **Results Presentation**: Prepare a report or presentation to communicate your findings and model performance to stakeholders.

These structured steps provide a comprehensive approach to handling data science projects from conception to documentation.

## Goal of Project

I am going to create 2 classifier models for this project.

### 1. Classifying Songs by Genre
1. **Data Collection**: 
- You need audio features that might indicate a genre, such as tempo, energy, danceability, and instrumentalness. Spotify’s API provides these features. 
- Metadata like artist, album, and track information can also provide contextual clues about genre.
2. **Feature Engineering**: 
- Consider creating additional features that might help in distinguishing genres, like beat patterns or frequency analysis results if you can process audio files directly.
- Normalize and scale features to ensure that distance-based algorithms (like K-Nearest Neighbors or SVMs) can perform optimally.
3. **Model Selection**: 
- Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting Machines can capture non-linear relationships between features and genres.
- Neural Networks, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are effective in capturing patterns in complex datasets like audio.
4. **Training and Validation**: 
- Split your data into training and testing sets to validate the model's performance.
- Use cross-validation to ensure that your model generalizes well across different subsets of your data.
5. **Evaluation**: 
- Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Analyze confusion matrices to understand misclassifications between genres.

### 2. Classifying Songs by Mood or Emotion
1. **Data Collection**:
- Along with audio features from Spotify, consider extracting features from lyrics using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, as lyrics can significantly convey the mood or emotion of a song.
- Textual sentiment analysis might reveal emotional content.
2. **Feature Engineering**:
- Use audio features like valence, which measures musical positiveness, and energy.
- From lyrics, derive sentiment scores, frequency of specific emotive words, and other NLP features such as topic modeling outputs.
3. **Model Selection**:
- Similar to genre classification, machine learning models that can handle nuanced patterns are ideal. Consider using ensemble methods or neural networks.
- For text data, models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) can be highly effective in understanding context and sentiment in lyrics.
4. **Training and Validation**:
- Ensure that your dataset is balanced across different moods to prevent bias toward more common emotions.
- Use stratified sampling when splitting the data to maintain proportionate representation of each class.
5. **Evaluation**:
- Accuracy might not be the best metric if the class distribution is imbalanced; consider using weighted F1 scores.
- Analyze the types of errors your model is making—does it confuse sadness with anger, or happiness with excitement?
